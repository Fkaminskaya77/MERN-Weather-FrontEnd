 The API's website I pulled my information from really stood out to me, compared to regular weather API services. WeatherAPI.com is equipped with AI and machine learning there API's deliver weather from global weather stations and high resolution weather models to be able to deliver fast, reliable and accurate weather for a given location anywhere in the world.

## Info about Authentication
For my Authentication I used a service called clerk.dev they make the process of setting up Authintication simpler with there great documentaion. I was able to create a sign in main page that gives you the oportunity to log in with your google account or create your own account with clerk.dev using a phone number, and or email. There is also multi-factor authentication and everytime you log in you get a code texted to your phone to make sure its you.
